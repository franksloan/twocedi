            <p>The idea for the Two Cedi clothing line came to founder Elliot Lartey in 2010, when he was studying graphic design at The College of Technology, Ghana. Elliot wanted to create casual wear that people could be proud of, which is why he uses local Ghanaian fabrics, like batik and tie dye patch work. The name Two Cedi arose from Elliot&#39s football buddies in Teshie, Accra. In October 2013 Elliot launched Two Cedi, selling T-shirts of the highest standards for both sexes. The shirts are printed locally in Teshie.</P>
            <p>The Two Cedi line has since grown, and now offers more than printed T-shirts. Two Cedi&#39s accessory line includes handmade sandals, wrist bands, hats, backpacks, and handbags. Particularly popular are the Chuck Taylors, which can be covered in any African print desired, and hand sewn shirts using African fabric. Two Cedi offers lightweight clothing, ideal to wear in tropical climates.</p>
            <p>The Two Cedi line continues to expand. Always combining flash with practicality, Elliot is now designing business attire using African prints, which is expected to be released in the coming months.</p>
